	<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
	<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment. Although there are no AIs that can perform the wide variety of tasks an ordinary human can do, some AIs can match humans in specific tasks.</p>
<p>AI and the Internet of Things. Data is all around us. The Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors have the ability to harness large volumes of data, while artificial intelligence (AI) can learn patterns in the data to automate tasks for a variety of business benefits.</p>
<p>Many products you already use will be improved with AI capabilities, much like Siri was added as a feature to a new generation of Apple products. Automation, conversational platforms, bots and smart machines can be combined with large amounts of data to improve many technologies.<img src="1*Ab8SnQ0cKCO7SUmTuqLKMg.jpg" width="415" height="284" alt=""/><img src="OIP-C.grFKBikWPHt3ESuOLsgjtgHaE8.jpeg" width="474" height="316" alt=""/></p>\
