	<h1>My favorite game</h1>

	<h2>My favorite game is named: "Counter-Strike:Global Offensive"</h2>
	<p>I like to play this game with two of my friends: Jack Zhang and Louie Bao. They are all very good at this game, and they also enjoy playing with me.</p>
	<p>You might wonder why I told you that story about our somewhat naïve attempt to qualify for the first Major tournament. For me that’s the core of what CS:GO is: it’s competition at its purest. </p>
<p>So that is why I like this game so much and why this game is my favorite game.</p>
